# Cassidoo Interview API (unofficial)

ðŸš¨ This project uses takes the interview questions from [Cassidy's](https://twitter.com/cassidoo) newsletter and displays them as a JSON API. It's _strongly_ recommended that if you use this API, you [subscribe to her newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/)ðŸš¨

## Purpose

This API is for learning purposes and comes in two flavors.

The first version is to showcase how to scrape data from a webpage. Due to this method scraping the data on demand, this version is significantly slower than the second version, but it also holds the benefit of not needing the overhead of a database.

**Coming Soon** The second version requires more setup, but demonstrates several useful concepts including webscraping and using [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/) to create an RESTful API that pulls data from DynamoDB.

## Routes

- [docs/baseurl](cassidoo-newsletter-api.vercel.app)
- `/api/interviewquestion/${number}`: Grabs the interview question from the passed in value. \*Note that while _most_ newsletters are captured, some aren't available, so it's best to think of this as a number and not correlated to a specific newsletter.
- `/api/interviewquestion/random`: Returns a random interview question
